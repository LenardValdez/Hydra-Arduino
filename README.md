# Hydra-Arduino-Sensors

The Source code of the firmware for HYDR-A The hydrophic Automation that is made for Arduino Due.

**Please understand that this project is not meant to be a plug and play project, this is meant to serve as a templae or guide on how to do your own hydropnic autmation using Arduino. That said you are free to change any part of the code to make it as your own or as fir to your project**

## Getting Started

These are the pre-requisites for this project

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* Arduino Due
* Seeed Studio Ethernet Shield 2.0
* Seeed Studio Grove base shield
* DFRobot PH Sensor v2
* DFRobot EC Sensor v2
* DFRobot Tempreture probe
* DFRobot TDS sensor
* DFRobot contact less sensor
* A302 Temperature and Humidity sensor
* 12V 8 Channel Relay
* 12V power Supply
* Grow light
* Bidirectional volt converter 3.5v to 5v (only if needed for sensors that cant handle 3.5v)

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
# Use PlatformIO as IDE
# use Atmel SAM3X8E Arduino framework
# git pull to the same project folder made by PlatformIO
$ git pull https://github.com/LenardValdez/Hydra-Arduino.git
```

## Usage

other useful commands and/or tasks.

```
# If your gonna use TLS/SSL generate your certificate.h by following the instruction on SSLClient
# SSL cert and key is a X.509 SSL1.2 generated with openssl
```

## Deployment

make sure you have you MQTT broker ready before turning of the arduino
